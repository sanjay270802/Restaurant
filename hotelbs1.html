                <p>Grilling or 'griddling' is a popular cooking method when it comes to cooking chicken. It keeps it
                    moist, is often healthier than frying and leaves you with a delicious charred flavour. Grilling
                    chicken requires a cast iron skillet pan. Follow this guide for tips and recipe ideas.</p>

                and minerals seafood contains. </p>
              <p class="card-text">Seafood is a healthful choice for people of all ages—
                growing children, pregnant women, active adults, and
                the elderly. Seafood is an excellent source of lean, high
                quality, easily digested protein. A 3.5-ounce serving of
                seafood provides almost half of an adult’s daily protein
                needs for only 100 to 200 calories. Seafood is low in saturated fat and sodium and is a rich source
                of many essential vitamins and minerals. Seafood also is one of the few
                foods that contain long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, which
                have many beneficial health effects and are essential for
                the development of the nervous system and retina.</p>

                Promote your table reservation system: encourage people to book a table so you know how many clients
                you will be serving. This will allow you to plan the food and schedule employees for the best
                customer experience.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text ">Have procedures in place for every type of situation: everyone working at the restaurant is only
                human and errors can occur. An order may be forgotten, or it may be wrong. However, the way
                employees react to these situations can save a situation and still satisfy customers. Create
                procedures for every type of possible event, so your employees know how they should react;</p>
            <p class="card-text" id="aboutourself">Ensure fair treatment and scheduling: if employees are unhappy with how they are treated, they won't
                be motivated to offer clients a great customer experience. Therefore, take all measures to help them
                feel satisfied with their job such as fair scheduling, benefits, and time off when they need it;</p>

            <p class="card-text">A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to
                customers.[1]
                Meals are generally
                served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery
                services.
                Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and
                service
                models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family
                restaurants,
                to
                high-priced luxury establishments.

            <h5 class="card-title text-danger">Vision</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The core values of your restaurant are the beliefs that dictate how you and your team behave. They are
              beliefs that your business won’t compromise, even if it means a boost in short-term (or long-term)
              profits.

              Core values typically relate to how you interact with restaurant customers, employees, and suppliers.
              They are different from your mission statement, although they will influence it.

              Some typical values include teamwork, service, quality, measurable customer satisfaction, and sourcing
              sustainable ingredients.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title text-danger">Mission</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Here is how the above steps could work in practice. Imagine we’re creating a restaurant mission
              statement for the owner of the fictional deep-dish pizza restaurant mentioned above.

              What does your restaurant do? We sell the best deep-dish pizza in the area and provide a fun experience
              for families.
              How does your restaurant do it? Our food tastes great because we use a special tomato sauce recipe that
              has been passed down over generations and we always buy fresh ingredients. We provide a great experience
              by focusing on the needs of each customer.
              Why does your restaurant do it? We hope to provide a new and unique dining experience for locals.</p>
